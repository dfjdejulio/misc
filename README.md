Misc Utilities
==============

I've written a bunch of little programs to help me get things done over the decades.
May as well stash them here...

iota
----

A trivial command-line program I built for my own use, based on APL's "iota" operator.

There's really almost nothing to it.  It was useful to me back in the day when it was
harder to do looping and such in shell scripts.

Since it doesn't have any special dependencies, you can built it by typing "make iota"
even without an Makefile, as long as you have C89 and a decent "make".
